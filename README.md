# Handling JSON files
This repository has two modules of code - one to create jsons with specific keys and random values. Some of the keys may not be available in a few json files. This is to test if the validator module detects the issue or not.

# Module 1
This module creates json files based on a blend of user input and randomness. 

# Module 2
We validate the different key and value pairs in the json files. We also consolidate the metrics and report.
